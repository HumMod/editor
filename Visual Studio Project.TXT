The source language is C#. The compiler is Microsoft Visual
Studio 2010.

We start with File | New | Project

Then select C# windows application.

It is a new solution, a Windows application named Model Solver.

Getting the project located in the correct folder is tricky.
I'm shooting for an existing SVN folder. So do not create a folder.
Instead, check an do not create folder option and Visual Studio
will do the rest.

The correct project details must be specified. They are

# New Project
# Windows
# Windows Application

This gets 2 forms files and a main program. Delete all
immediately. Then add your stuff.

Under Properties | Application, attach icon to application.

Under Properties | Builds, direct compiler output to the
project root. Otherwise, it is buried in bin\Debug.
